## About the Project

We love science and our goal is to test everything in our daily lives for chemicals that might do us harm.
We test household products for toxic chemicals like phthalates, BPA, arsenic, mercury, etc and publish the raw data on GitHub.
We also make videos discussing our findings and trying to educate people on what they can do to mitigate risks from these chemicals. 

We welcome contributions and discussion. Requests to add compounds to our tests or to test specific products can be made on our [https://discord.gg/9FHx47UHcR](Discord).
